This guide will help you set up your own instance of the MobileMiles server. It is a little involved and will probably take a couple hours, depending on your level of expertise.

What you'll need
----------------

First off, you'll probably want a box running a relatively modern Linux build. I'll be using [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server) for this tutorial, but use whatever works best for you.

Additionally, you'll need:

- [git](http://www.git-scm.com/)
- [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) (0.10.x recommended)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (2.x recommended)
- Ruby's [bundler gem](http://bundler.io/)
- [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) (9.3.x recommended)
