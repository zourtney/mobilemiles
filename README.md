Mobilemiles API
===============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zourtney/mobilemiles.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/zourtney/mobilemiles)

RESTful API aimed at tracking vehicle maintenance and fill-up statistics. Originally bred out of a simple web interface for a Google Spreadsheet to track gas mileage, this version will incorporate the following features:

- Users
- Vehicles tied to users
- Track fill-up stats (# of gallons, price, etc, plus calculated things such as MPG)
- Commonly used locations
- Maintenance records (oil changes, etc)
- Upcoming maintenance alerts

If you have further suggestions, feel free to create an issue.
