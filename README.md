Mobilemiles API
===============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zourtney/mobilemiles.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/zourtney/mobilemiles)

RESTful API for tracking vehicle maintenance and fill-up statistics. Originally bred out of a simple web interface for a Google Spreadsheet to track gas mileage, this version will incorporate the following features:

- Users
- Vehicles associated to users
- Track fill-up stats (# of gallons, price, etc, plus calculated things such as MPG)
- Commonly used locations
- Maintenance records (oil changes, etc)
- Upcoming maintenance alerts

If you have further suggestions, feel free to create an issue.

Official webapp
---------------

A full-featured webapp is being built out in conjunction with this revision of the API. A hosted version is available on [mobilemiles-ui.herokuapp.com](http://mobilemiles-ui.herokuapp.com/). Full source code for that project is also available on my [mobilemiles-ui repo](https://github.com/zourtney/mobilemiles-ui).

Previous version
----------------

The previous version has been deprecated, but will continue to be hosted at [gas.randomland.net](http://gas.randomland.net). The source can be found in the [1.0 tag](https://github.com/zourtney/mobilemiles/tree/1.0) of this project.
