{"name":"Mobilemiles","tagline":"Track fuel consumption, oil changes, and more -- straight from your phone","body":"Mobilemiles\r\n===========\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zourtney/mobilemiles.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/zourtney/mobilemiles)\r\n\r\nMobilemiles is a simple application for tracking vehicle maintenance and fill-up statistics. Originally bred out of a simple web interface for a Google Spreadsheet to track gas mileage, this latest version harnesses the power of Ruby and modern web application technologies.\r\n\r\nOfficial webapp\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nA full-featured webapp is being built out in conjunction with this revision of the API. A hosted version is available on [mobilemiles-ui.herokuapp.com](http://mobilemiles-ui.herokuapp.com/). Full source code for that project is also available on my [mobilemiles-ui repo](https://github.com/zourtney/mobilemiles-ui).\r\n\r\nPrevious version\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe previous version has been deprecated, but will continue to be hosted at [gas.randomland.net](http://gas.randomland.net). The source can be found in the [1.0 tag](https://github.com/zourtney/mobilemiles/tree/1.0) of this project.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
