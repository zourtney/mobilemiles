MobileMiles is a simple application specifically designed to help you track everyday vehicle records. For now, its main focus is tracking fuel consumption.

Version 2 is built from the ground up on modern technologies. This allows for powerful new features:

- Multiple users
- Vehicles associated to users
- Track gas station fill-ups (vehicle mileage, gallons pumped, price, etc)
- Commonly used locations *coming soon*
- New maintenance record types (oil changes, etc) *coming soon*
- Historical trends *coming soon*
- Upcoming maintenance alerts *coming soon*

Official webapp
---------------

A full-featured webapp has been built from the ground up in version 2, available from any modern web browser at [mobilemiles-ui.herokuapp.com](http://mobilemiles-ui.herokuapp.com/).

Whenever you're at the pump, simply open the "New fill-up" page on your smartphone, fill out a few fields, and submit it. Over time, you'll amass a good set of data that can help you predict cost and consumptions trends.

As an API
---------

From its inception, version 2 has been built around the idea that a good application needs a good API. The [back-end](https://github.com/zourtney/mobilemiles) code is headless, and yet fully complete. A hosted version is available at [mobilemiles.herokuapp.com](http://mobilemiles.herokuapp.com).

API documentation coming soon...
