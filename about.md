Mobilemiles is a simple web application specifically designed to help you track everyday vehicle records. For now, its main focus is tracking fuel consumption. Whenever you're at the pump, simply open the "New fill-up" page on your smartphone, fill out a few fields, and save. Over time, you'll amass a good data set that can tell you average gas mileage, fuel cost trends, and more.

Version 2 is built from the ground up on modern technologies. This allows for powerful new features:

- Multiple users
- Vehicles associated to users
- Track gas station fill-ups (vehicle mileage, gallons pumped, price, etc)
- Commonly used locations *coming soon*
- New maintenance record types (oil changes, etc) *coming soon*
- Historical trends *coming soon*
- Upcoming maintenance alerts *coming soon*

As an API
---------

From its inception, version 2 has been built around the idea that a good application needs a good API. The [back-end](https://github.com/zourtney/mobilemiles) code is headless, and yet fully complete. A hosted version is available at [mobilemiles.herokuapp.com](http://mobilemiles.herokuapp.com).

API documentation coming soon...

Official webapp
---------------

A full-featured webapp has been built in conjuction with the version 2 API. To enforce front- and back-end separation of concerns, it is a completely separate project, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/zourtney/mobilemiles-ui). A hosted version is available at [mobilemiles-ui.herokuapp.com](http://mobilemiles-ui.herokuapp.com/).

Previous version
----------------

Version 1.x is deprecated, but will continue to be hosted at [gas.randomland.net](http://gas.randomland.net). The source can be found in the [1.0 tag](https://github.com/zourtney/mobilemiles/tree/1.0).
